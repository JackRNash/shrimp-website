            The Whistling Shrimp (est. 1984) is Cornell's oldest comedy troupe.
            We specialize in long-form improvisation, where ideas, characters and scenes are all made up on the spot and
            can be as short as 30 seconds or as long as 30 minutes. We perform two big shows a semester, with various
            gigs, mini shows
            and festivals at other colleges speckled in between.

            If you have any questions, inquiries, curiosities or comments, don't hesitate to email us at

            <div id="improv_faq">
                <h3>Improv</h3>
                <h4>What is it exactly that you do?</h4>
                <p>We improvise! We take audience suggestions and using them to create everything from monologues to
                    scenes to mini-plays on the spot, all of which are hilarious.</p>
                <h4>Do you ever reuse material?</h4>
                <p>Nope! Even from practice we'll NEVER reuse a scene. Making it up on the fly leads to better scenes,
                    and a better experience for the audience. Also that means that every one of our shows, even the ones
                    on the same weekend, are totally, 100% different, new material.</p>
                <h4>Then how can you possibly practice?</h4>
                <p>We practice doing scenes (with our own suggestions) and do exercises (yes there are improv
                    exercises). The point of practice is not to gain a repertoire of jokes, but to get used to
                    performing with the other members and to learn how to consistently build a hilarious scene from
                    scratch.</p>
                <h4>Wait... so... are you an A Cappella group?</h4>
                <p>No! Please stop asking.</p>
                <h4>But you sing, right?</h4>
                <p>Very poorly.</p>
                <h4>Well then, heheh, do you whistle?</h4>
                <p>Nope.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="shows_faq">
                <h3>Shows</h3>
                <h4>Should I come to a show?</h4>
                <p> Absolutely! There's nothing quite like watching scenes being written and performed on the spot
                    in front of you. Come, you'll have an absolute blast.</p>
                <h4>I'm in! Where can I get tickets?</h4>
                <p>If you know a shrimp member or see us advertising around campus, buy tickets <b>in person</b>.
                    Emailing
                    us at <b>shrimp@cornell.edu</b> will reserve you tickets. And in an interesting new turn of events
                    you can
                    purchase your ticket ONLINE! You can also get tickets <b>at the door</b> before a show, but if it's
                    already
                    sold out you might not get a seat. Get or reserve your tickets in advance!</p>
                <h4>That show was AWESOME, how do I know when the next one is?</h4>
                <p>The best thing to do is join our list-serv (email us at shrimp@cornell.edu and we'll add you). You'll
                    get updates about shows and performances, and we promise not to send more than a couple emails a
                    semester. We're not jerks. Also, keep an eye out for posters, pamphlets and the occasional shrimp
                    running around in a maroon shirt. These usually herald an upcoming show.</p>
                <h4>I was disappointed that there was no A Cappella at your show.</h4>
                <p>That is not a question.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="auditions_faq">
                <h3>Auditions</h3>
                <h4>When are auditions?</h4>
                <p>We hold auditions every September. Look for us at the beginning of the Fall semester!</p>
                <h4>Should I try out?</h4>
                <p>Yes! Auditions are fun, as well as stress and judgment free. Also, we usually take an even split of
                    people with and without previous experience, so don't feel like you need to know what you're doing
                    to try out.</p>
                <h4>How many new members do you take?</h4>
                <p>It varies every year. We don't have a maximum number; if we love five people who try out, we'll take
                    them all. The number has typically ranged from two to five, with everything in between.</p>
                <h4>Seriously though, you're an A Cappella group aren't you?</h4>
                <p>Still no.</p>
